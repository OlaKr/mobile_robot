The aim of the study was to design a robot with domestic use. For this purpose an entertaining vehicle was created. This toy can be controlled through two modes. The first mode is responsible for controlling the mobile robot using a specially developed ControlMI application. This application is supported by Android devices. The second control mode is based on lighting the area in front of the robot. Thanks to appropriate sensors placed on the casing, the vehicle can follow the light. Another feature of the programmed robot is the ability to play a song. The casing was an additional element to design. Thanks to the housing the created robot looks like a toy.
